Subject: Re: Submission for exercise 2

I checked your exercise: it was very good. You can continue with the
next one. I only have some minor comment:

- Your program does not work stand alone. It runs only from Visual
Studio. Usually this is caused by using incorrect directory paths when
loading image or model files. Being stand alone is one of the
requirements of the final project.
