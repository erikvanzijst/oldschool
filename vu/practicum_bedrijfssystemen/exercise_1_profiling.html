<P><I><font face="Times New Roman">Changelog:</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">17/2: Changed descriptions of GETPROF, return values of the system calls, and 
of the user program. Updated hint for copying the results, in 'hints and notes'. 
Please reread this page carefully, it contains significant changes.</font></I> 
<P><I><font face="Times New Roman">11/2, added sections 2.5 and 2.6 to "recommended reading".</font> </I></P>
<H2><font face="Times New Roman">Introduction</font></H2><font face="Times New Roman">Profiling is a very useful tool for code development, as it 
consists the application's X-ray map in terms of its execution time. More 
precisely, profiling is a statistical tool that provides detailed information on 
the time spent by the CPU on each line of a program during its execution. This 
generally gives the programmer a better understanding of the program's runtime 
behaviour, as well as valuable help for making performance improvements. It 
occasionally also provides good hints for discovering bugs.</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">To profile a process, the operating system allocates a large number of 
counters, called <I>bins</I>, each corresponding to a small range of bytes in 
the program's code. The more the counters, the finer the profiling granularity. 
By means of an interrupt, the operating system periodically checks (many times 
per second) which instruction the process is executing, and increases the 
respective bin by one. Eventually, the bins' values give a good statistical 
approximation of the percentage of time the CPU spent within each little slice 
of the program code.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">The low-level nature of profiling, prevents it from being implemented as a 
user-level tool. It has to be taken care of by the operating system's kernel. 
Unfortunately the Minix 2.0.0 kernel does not support it. Your task is to add 
support for profiling to the Minix kernel, and write a user program that 
retrieves and presents profiling data in a useful way.</font></P>
<H2><font face="Times New Roman">Part I: Add profiling support to the Minix kernel</font></H2><font face="Times New Roman">You have to modify the 
kernel to support profiling. You should define two new system calls:</font> 
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman"><B>PROFILE</B> : Starts profiling. Takes three parameters: the PID of the 
  process to be profiled, and the lowest and highest addresses of the range of 
  code to be profiled. Calling it with PID 0 (zero), should stop the ongoing 
  profiling (if any). Calling PROFILE with PID != 0 while already profiling some 
  process, should result in an error. Calling PROFILE with lowest <I>and</I> 
  highest addresses 0, should profile the whole code of the process. In that 
  case, for processes with separate I &amp; D (text and data) segments the 
  system call should profile the text segment. For processes with combined I 
  &amp; D segments, it should profile the combined text and data segment, 
  excluding the stack.</font> 
  <P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Return values:</B> Upon successful completion, PROFILE returns 0. 
  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and <I>errno</I> is set to indicate the 
  error. The following error codes are defined for profile:</font> 
  <P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ESRCH:</B> no process with 
  the given pid exists (except for special case of pid 0, which should never 
  return any errors)</font> 
  <P><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B> EFAULT:</B> if there is some 
  error related to the memory arguments (i.e. start memory &gt; end memory, or 
  any of the arguments out of range)</font> 
  <P><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>EBUSY:</B> if profiling for 
  some process is already active</font> 
  <P><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>EGENERIC:</B> for any other 
  type of failure</font> </P></LI></UL>
<UL></UL>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman"><B>GETPROF</B> : Retrieves the information collected by profiling. It 
  takes one argument: a pointer to a <I>struct prof_data</I> allocated in the 
  user program (defined in <A 
  href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~bs/profstub.h">profstub.h</A>) variable, where the 
  profiling addresses and the profiling buffer (containing all the bin counters) 
  should be copied to.</font> 
  <P><font face="Times New Roman"><B>Return values:</B> Upon successful completion, GETPROF returns 0. If an 
  error occurs, GETPROF returns -1. Errno is set to indicate the error. The 
  following error codes are defined:</font> 
  <P><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>EFAULT:</B> a memory error 
  has occurred (e.g., trying to write to memory not belonging to the calling 
  user process)</font> </P></LI></UL><font face="Times New Roman">The files <A 
href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~bs/profstub.h">profstub.h</A> and <A 
href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~bs/profstub.c">profstub.c</A> are provided. These 
files define the data and message formats to which your application should 
adhere. It is obligatory to use this header file and the stub routines, as 
defined here, to access the system calls.</font> 
<H2><font face="Times New Roman">Part II: Retrieve and present profiling data</font></H2>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">This part of the assignment is meant to help you experiment with the usage of 
the first part. Write a utility that profiles the execution of a given program, 
and outputs some data and a simple histogram (in ASCII) of the program's 
execution time.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">The utility (called <I>profile</I>) should have the following syntax:</font> 
<P><B><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; profile [-n number_of_rows] [-r 
startaddr-endaddr] program-name [program_arguments ...]</font></B> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Profile has one mandatory argument, program-name, which is the name of the 
program to be profiled. Arguments following the program_name should be passed on 
as arguments to the profiled program. I.e., in the following, "-laF" should be 
passed as an argument to /bin/ls :</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>profile /bin/ls -laF</B> 
</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Optional is the argument -n, which specifies the number of bars (rows) in 
which the histogram is divided. For example, assuming all 1024 bins have been 
used in a profiling, the command:</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>profile -n 25 ls /</B> 
</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">will output a histogram of 25 lines, each aggregating the profiling data of 
41 bins (because 1024/25 = 40.96), to provide a histogram of 25 lines (the 25th 
line, though, will be the sum of only the last 40 bins). In principle, divide 
the number of bins used (*) by the number of lines, and <B>round up</B> to get 
the number of bins that should be aggregated per line. The last line may display 
the sum of fewer bins than the rest of the lines. If the number of rows given by 
the -n argument is greater than the number of bins used, ignore it, and display 
as many rows as the number of bins used.</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">(*) calculate the number of bins used just like the PROFILE system call does, 
based on the starting and ending addresses, according to the methodology 
described in 'Hints and Notes'.</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Optional is also the argument -r, which defines the range of addresses to be 
profiled. Addresses should be passed as decimal numbers, separated by "-" (minus 
sign), as in this example:</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>profile -r 500-3700 
./myprog</B> 
</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">If the r argument is used, <I>startaddr</I> should be lower than 
<I>endaddr</I>. Else return an error code.</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">It should be possible to use both the -n and -r arguments simultaneously.</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">When a program has less than 1024 bytes of code, or when a range is used that 
is less than 1024 bytes, a number of the bins allocated in the kernel are not 
used. Your <I>profile</I> program should output a histogram that represents only 
the bins really used. For instance, if the argument "-n 25" is given to profile 
a program where only 500 bins were used (i.e., the program code is 500 bytes 
long), each line of the histogram should correspond to 20 bins (=500/25) to span 
a range of 500 addresses, instead of 41 (=1024/25) like in the example above.</font> 
<H3><font face="Times New Roman">Error codes:</font></H3>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><I>profile</I> returns <B>0</B> upon successful completion, and a value 
<B>&gt;0 </B>if an error has occurred. No debug output should be reported to 
stdout.</font> 
<H3><font face="Times New Roman">Output:</font></H3><font face="Times New Roman">Output should be directed to the <I>standard output (stdout)</I> 
and should follow strictly the style shown in the <A 
href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~bs/exercise_1_sample_output.txt">sample output</A>. 
The first line should contain the filename of the profiled executable. The 
second should show the scale of the histogram. The histogram should scale from 
0% (no asterisks), to the percentage of the line with the highest value (62 
asterisks). Therefore, the second line should write "SCALE :" at columns 11-17, 
"0%" at columns 19-20, dots in columns 21-77, and the percentage of the line 
with highest percentage (i.e. "46%") at columns 78-80. The percentage should be 
of length 2, left-padded with zeros (i.e. "07%").</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Starting in the third line, it should output the histogram of the profiling 
data. Particularly, each line should start with the address range it represents 
(two 4-digit hex left-padded-with-zero numbers, separated by "-"), a space 
followed by the percentage (in parentheses) of CPU time spent in the bin(s) of 
that line. Then have space, colon(<B>:</B>), space again, and finally a number 
of asterisks (<B>*</B>) proportional to the bin's value. For the minimum value 
(0%) there should be no asterisk. For the maximum value, whatever that is, there 
should be 62 asterisks to reach the 80th column. Show no more lines than that 
correspond to the addresses that have actually been profiled.</font> 
<P><font face="Times New Roman">If that's all Greek to you, look at the <A 
href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~bs/exercise_1_sample_output.txt">sample output</A> 
that we provide, and follow it strictly.</font></P>
<P><font face="Times New Roman"><I><B>HINTS:</B></I> Here is a brief (=not exhaustive!) outline suggestion 
for your program: Your utility should <B>fork</B>. The child process should 
<B>exec</B>ute the given program. The parent should use your <B>PROFILE</B> 
system call to start profiling on the child's PID and then <B>wait</B> for the 
child to terminate. Then the parent should stop profiling (invoking 
<B>PROFILE</B> with pid 0), and call <B>GETPROF </B>to retrieve the array of 
bins. Finally it should output the histogram and statistics to the standard 
output.</font></P>
<H2><font face="Times New Roman">Hints and Notes</font></H2>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">To make the assignment instructions more concrete, we provide you with the 
following directions that should be followed:</font></P>
<UL>
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman">Use <B>4-byte-long bins</B>, and treat each of them as an unsigned long, 
  to count from 0 to 4,294,967,295 ticks.</font> 
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman">Use a fixed, static, system-wide allocation of <B>4096 bytes</B>, to 
  accommodate <B>1024 bins</B> (in kernel memory).</font> 
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman">The system call number of PROFILE is required to be <B>77</B>. The system 
  call number of GETPROF is to be <B>78</B>. It is obligatory to use these 
  numbers.</font> 
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman">The system calls are placed in the memory manager; the actual work is done 
  in the kernel. You'll therefore have to also add two calls to the kernel, to 
  let the memory manager communicate with it. Find logical places and names for 
  this extra functionality. Discuss your solution with your supervisor.</font> 
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman">Since we have a fixed number of 1024 bins, granularity will depend on the 
  size of the code region being profiled. Allocate as many bytes of code per bin 
  as needed to just cover up all the code. HINT: <B>Divide the code size by 1024 
  </B>and <B>round up</B> to find how many bytes fall in one bin. I.e. for a 
  process having exactly 40.000 bytes of code, you should assume 40 bytes per 
  bin, so that the whole code is covered. In this case, the last 24 bins are not 
  used, that is, their counters are never touched (they remain 0). A worst-case 
  scenario would be profiling a 1025-byte-long program. Then only the first 513 
  bins are used, each bin representing 2 bytes (the 513th bin representing just 
  1 byte), and the last 511 bins would be unused.</font> 
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman">In case of profiling a code region of less than 1024 bytes, just allocate 
  one byte per bin, and let the excess bins be wasted.</font> 
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman">Calculate the number of bins that have actually been used based on the 
  starting and ending address returned by GETPROF, and display only the rows 
  corresponding to the addresses that are actually profiled.</font> 
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman">In the rare situation that one of the bins is totally full (has reached 
  the maximum value of 4,294 billion), just cease profiling automatically.</font> 
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman">For copying the profiling buffer from kernel to user space (in the 
  implementation of GETPROF), (a) figure out the physical address of the buffer 
  in kernel space, (b) find the physical address of the destination buffer in 
  user space, and (c) use the <B>phys_copy()</B> function to copy the 4096 
  bytes.</font> 
  <LI><font face="Times New Roman">The time spent while a process is <B>blocked</B> (i.e., sleep(), or 
  waiting of I/O) should be ignored during profiling (i.e., no bins are 
  increased).</font> </LI></UL>
<H2><font face="Times New Roman">Recommended reading</font></H2><font face="Times New Roman">The following parts of the minix book are 
recommended for (re)reading for this exercise (this is not intended as an 
exhaustive list): <B>Sections 2.2.7, 2.5, 2.6, 3.8, 4.7 up to 4.7.4.</B> 
Furthermore, study relevant information in the Minix book about the clock, 
system calls, system task, and message handling. It is generally important to 
understand the Minix code on message passing (proc.c) and interrupts.</font> 
<H2><font face="Times New Roman">Testing</font></H2>
<P><font face="Times New Roman">Here is a suggestion for testing your exercise. Write a program with expected 
behaviour (i.e. include at various places loops of 1, 2, and 3 million (or 
billion!) iterations, that just waste time). Profile it, and check whether the 
output shows a realistic execution time distribution for your program (i.e. 
number of asterisks analogous to the number of iterations of the sample 
loops).</font></P></BODY></HTML>
