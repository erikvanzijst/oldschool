<h2>
File System Compaction</h2>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
After deletion of old files and generation of new files, the blocks of
many files in a filesystem will often be noncontiguous, that is, the blocks
will no longer be adjacent to each other. In Minix, filesystem fragmentation
can occur easily because of its mechanism for allocating new blocks.
<p>Fragmentation can cause performance problems, since reading in a (set
of) block(s) of a file means that the disk head has to move to different,
possibly non adjacent, locations on the disk. In this project, you have
to write a simple defragmentation program.
<h3>
Program description</h3>
The command you need to implement is:
<center><b>defrag&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;oldfs>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;newfs></b></center>
Oldfs is the filesystem that needs to be defragmented. Newfs is the device
that the defragmented filesystem has to be written to. Newfs may have a
different size than oldfs, as long as oldfs fits on the newfs. The new
fs should contain a clean minix V2 filesystem, generated using mkfs (see
<b>mkfs (1)</b>). Defrag should exit with an error if the old filesystem
does not fit on the new filesystem or when the new filesystem is not a
V2 filesystem. In that case, newfs is not written. Files or directories
that use triple indirect blocks are not supported.
<h3>
Output</h3>
On successful execution, defrag puts one line on standard output, which
has the format:
<pre>Defragmented filesystem written to /dev/hd3a</pre>
where /dev/hd3a should be replaced by the actual output device that the
program wrote the output fs to. In case of an error, at most one line of
output on standard output is permitted which describes the error that occurred
in user-understandable text. Do not place a newline character before your
output message. Messages should be written to stdout, not stderr.
<h3>
Error codes</h3>
For any error, return a value > 0. Successful execution results in a 0
being returned. Below is a list of return values that your program should
return in case of an error.
<ul>
<li>
1 - invalid arguments</li>

<li>
2 - File not found or file cannot be opened.</li>

<li>
3 - Input / output filesystem is not a Minix V2 filesystem</li>

<li>
4 - Target filesystem is not empty</li>

<li>
5 - Target filesystyem is too small to copy all files of the source FS.</li>

<li>
6 - Input-filesystem inconsistency (run fsck)</li>

<li>
7 - Other errors (e.g., read / write error, should normally not occur).</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The files in the new file system have to have the same time information
and attributes as the files in the old fs.</li>

<li>
Inodes are to keep their inode-number and location exactly as they were
on the input-filesystem. No changes to content of the directory or data
blocks are allowed.</li>

<li>
The files and directories in the new filesystem should consist of a contiguous
sequence of blocks and indirect blocks.</li>

<li>
Assume zone size = block size = 1 KB. This means that you can read block
whenever zone is used in this document and vice versa.</li>

<li>
Check that the input and output-filesystems contain a valid Minix V2 filesystem
with native byte-ordering. V1 filesystems or V2 filesystems with reverse
byte ordering are not supported.</li>

<li>
The target-filesystem must be empty (except for the root directory generated
by mkfs) and should have enough space to contain the files of the old filesystem
after defragmentation.</li>
</ul>

<ul><b>Order of the indirect blocks:</b>
<br>Blocks in the target-fs are to be ordered the following way:
<ul>
<li>
The first blocks are the direct blocks.</li>

<li>
After the direct blocks comes the first single indirect block (if applicable),
followed by the blocks pointed to by the single indirect block.</li>

<li>
After the single indirect blocks, follows (if applicable) the intermediate
block of the second indirect, followed by, for each second indirect, the
second indirect block, and then the blocks pointed to by the second indirect
block.</li>

<li>
This means that, given a second indirect intermediate block that has block
pointers to two second indirect blocks, we first find the intermediate
block (directly after the last block of the single indirect), and then
the first second indirect block pointed to by the intermediate block, followed
by the datablocks that the second indirect block points to, after which
the next second indirect block that the intermediate block points to, followed
in turn by the datablock(s) that this double indirect block points to.
<b>The ordering requirement has to be followed exactly. Other orderings
of the blocks will not be accepted. Our automated test programs check for
this ordering.</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>
Additional Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>
You should generate a empty file system with <b>mkfs(1)</b> in advance
and use <b>fsck</b> to check filesystem integrity.</li>

<li>
Holes in an input-file need to be maintained and copied to the output-file
as is. A hole in a file is noted as a NO_ZONE block-pointer in an inode
or indirect block. The filesystem interprets a hole as a block containing
'\0' chars; no block is allocated for the hole. Holes normally do not exist
in minix files, but some applications (e.g., dbm) may create holes. Under
minix, holes can be created using dd with the seek argument (see man <b>dd(1)</b>).</li>

<li>
Directories and regular files contain block pointers that refer to a datablock
on the disk. Other inode types (e.g., character devices) may store other
information in the block pointers. This information should be maintained
in (copied to) the output file system.</li>

<li>
Please use the data structures and constants from the minix file system.
You can include the filesystem header files directly, in addition to the
regular header files from /usr/include[/minix]. An example header file
is provided that should be useable in most cases (<a href="defrag.h">defrag.h</a>),
though it is not mandatory to use this file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Testing</h3>
You should generate an fragmented filesystem yourself. An example way to
do that is to copy (using cp or dd) the minix root-fs to an empty fs of
equal size, and to make some changes to it to make sure that it contains
inconsistent files (if it does not contain them already). Use sync prior
to copying, and possibly run 'fsck -a' on the copied filesystem afterward
to make sure that it does not contain inconsistencies. Do not use defrag
on used (mounted) filesystems directly.
<p>You should test all requirements that are listed in this description
carefully. fsck (-s) is a useful tool to inspect your output-fs. Of course,
you can also mount the target-fs to see whether it still functions and
looks the same as the original fs. You should probably use debugging code
in your program to see what goes on while defragmenting (e.g., display
the input and output inode and zone bitmaps), but make sure that this code
is turned off in your submitted assignment (your code may not be accepted
for basic testing if it outputs debugging information).
<p>There exist some test partitions on the minix machines in S4.11 at the
VU. They are:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /dev/hd3a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1440k
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /dev/hd3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1440k
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /dev/hd3c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70M
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /dev/hd3d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70M</pre>
You can verify whether the partitions exist using the command:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; df /dev/hd3?</pre>
<b>de</b>, the minix disk editor (see <b>de(9)</b>) can be a very convenient
tool to inspect the content of your input / output disk. Type <b>?</b>
after starting <i>de</i> to see a list of options.
<h3>
Hints for implementation</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Leave the data structures that are generated by mkfs (except for the root-directory's
inode and block) on the target-fs untouched.</li>

<li>
Use in-memory buffers for the inode /zone bitmaps. Manipulation of these
bitmaps is much easier than on-disk. You can write these bitmaps to disk
when you finished defragmentation.</li>

<li>
The indexing of the inode bitmap and the inode placement in the inode-list
do not map one-to-one. Contrary to what may be understood from some places
in the code, inode 0 is *not* present on the disk. This also applies to
the zone bitmap. Section 5.6.2 in the book explains this correctly. <i>However,
the explanation in /usr/src/fs/super.h may be misleading in this respect.</i></li>

<li>
The zone bitmap only concerns the <b>data</b> zones!.</li>

<li>
It may convenient to write a couple of macros for convering inode, resp.
zone numbers to numbers which are usable for bitmap manipulation.</li>

<li>
Defrag is a userspace program. It is not allowed to change existing system
calls or add new system calls to Minix.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Recommended reading</h3>
Most important reading for this assignment is section 5.6 (at least up
to 5.6.6). For understanding of the filesystem code, read on in section
5.7. However, as you will not use or change the filesystem code directly,
you may skip this section.
<p>For inspiration on how to do things, you may look in /usr/src/fs, and
maybe some code in /usr/src/commands/simple/. Inspecting the header files
that are included in our example header file <a href="defrag.h">defrag.h</a>,
and keeping a printout of the header-files containing the relevant data
structures beside you can be very handy.
<p>We advise you to write your program completely from scratch. It is forbidden
(and also inadviseable) to copy code directly. Most existing code will
not do exactly what you want. Furthermore, obvious reuse of existing code
will be noticed by us since we know where to look.
