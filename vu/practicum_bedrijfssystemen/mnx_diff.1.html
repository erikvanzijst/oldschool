<h2>
mnx_diff - find differences between hard disk and floppy MINIX
<hr></h2>
<h2>SYNOPSYS</h2>
<b>mnx_diff
</b>[<i>drive</i>]
<i>output-name
</i><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<b>Mnx_diff
</b>selects all the files that are different between those on the hard disk
and those on a set of floppies created with
<b>mnx_backup</b>(1)
and puts them in a directory named
<i>output-name
</i>and a compressed tarfile named
<i>output-name</i><b>.tar.Z</b>.<tt> </tt>
The optional
<i>drive
</i>argument may be used to select a drive other than
<b>/dev/fd0
</b>in the same way as
<b>mnx_backup</b>.<tt> </tt>
<h3>Suggested Use</h3>
The best way to use this program is as follows:
<p>
<dl><dt><dd>
First make sure that your version works, load it onto the hard disk and run
<b>make hdboot
</b>to make sure that it compiles.  Test it.<tt> </tt>
<br>
Check that everything looks as you want it to, no unnecessary files
lingering around.  Make sure that your extra tools are in
<b>/usr/src/extra</b>.<tt> </tt>
<br>
Use
<b>mnx_backup
</b>to save your files on a set of backup diskettes.<tt> </tt>
<br>
Run
<b>mnx_fresh
</b>as root to put the machine back in its original state.<tt> </tt>
<br>
Finally it is time to run
<b>mnx_diff</b>.<tt> </tt>
Type
<b>cd
</b>to get back to
<b>/usr/src</b>,
and run the following command
(<b>kjb
</b>is just some random persons login-name, anything goes):
<br>
<dl><dt><dd>
<b>mnx_diff kjb
</b></dl>
<br>
It will ask you to insert floppies, compares and extracts changed files
from the all the directories on backup.  Except for the
<b>tools
</b>directory, from it only the important file
<b>image
</b>is copied, because it contains the kernel to be tested.<tt> </tt>
</dl>
<h3>Copying to UNIX</h3>
<b>Mnx_diff
</b>leaves two results, one directory containing all the files that it found
different (check this), and a compressed tarfile of the same stuff.<tt> </tt>
<p>
To get the latter file to a UNIX host you can use the
<b>ftp
</b>command, for example:
<p>
<dl><dt><dd>
<pre>
! <b>ftp keg</b>
220 keg FTP server (UNIX(r) System V Release 4.0) ready.

ftp&gt;<b>put kjb.tar.Z</b>
200 Port command okay.
