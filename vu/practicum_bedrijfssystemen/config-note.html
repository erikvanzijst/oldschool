<H1>Notes on config.h and the tar-archives made by mnx_diff</H1>
<p>
</B>

<p>
If you change something in /usr/include/minix/config.h, this change will show up in the
tarfile that you submit using mnx_diff and bs_submit. As your kernel will be
rebuilt by us, the config.h that you submit must be similar to ours.
Parameters such as NR_PROCS, NR_PTYS, and network-related ones are particularly 
important.<p>
A number of parameters that are used at the minix installations on the
VU are different from the ones
found in the config.h on the CDROM distributed with the book.
Therefore, you should make sure that either the config.h file from the
VU is included in the
tar-file you submit to us (possibly with additions made by you, although this
is not recommended or encouraged), 
or preferably that no config.h is included in the tar-file at all, i.e., 
there were no changes made to the config.h file.<p>
As an aside, do not build your own tar-file. Only if you use the mnx_diff
script, can you be reasonably sure our test routines will accept the archive.
Before submitting your archive using bs_submit, you may want to check the content of
the tar-file using 'gtar tvfz filename.tar.Z'.
However, this still does not guarantee acceptance of the archive if you have
built it yourself, since gtar recognizes several compression formats.<p>
