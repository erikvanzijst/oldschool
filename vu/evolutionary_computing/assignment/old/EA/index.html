<h1 align="center">Practical assignment for<br>Evolutionary Algorithms<br>October 2002</h1>
<p align="left"></p>

<p>

</p><p>
In this practical assignment you are required to write a program in Java that
optimizes a secret function using an evolutionary algorithm. Besides of writing
the software you will have to write a report in which you describe
your algorithm.
This description should include not only the algorithm components, but also
the motivation behind preferring them to others.

</p><p>
The performance of your algorithm determines the half of your grade for the
practical assignment (see later exactly how).
Your report (and programming) will determine the other half.
The report should consist of at most six pages,
including figures and references.
The final grade of the course is
(Practical grade)/4 + 3(``Tentamen'' grade)/4,
in concordance with the distribution of ``study points''.
Note that both grades, the practical and the tentamen, have to be
``voldoende'', i.e. at least 6.

</p>
<p> The practical assignment should be performed in groups of at most two persons. 
  Before starting the assignment send an email to <a href="mailto:schut@cs.vu.nl">Martijn</a> 
  about your group. </p>

Things to have in mind</a>
</h1>

<p>
When you start creating your evolutionary algorithm be sure you have all the
ingredients clearly written down. Here is a list of the most common
ingredients:

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>representation
</li><li>initialization procedure
</li><li>evolutionary operators
  <ul>
<li>mutation
</li><li>crossover
  </li></ul>
</li><li>fitness function
</li><li>selection procedures
  <ul>
<li>parent selection
</li><li>survivors selection
  </li></ul>
</li><li>stop criteria
</li></ul>
<p>
There is no recipe for writing a good evolutionary algorithm for a given
problem.
The techniques you have learned during the course provide a toolbox
which you can use to build your algorithm for the given problem.
Experiment with them to find the most suitable ones.

</p><p>
Document your code as this should be easy to read and understand when we
verify your report with your actual running algorithm. When programming, it
is possible that you need to change your initial plans. Maybe because you
overlooked something or maybe because the performance is too low. In any
case, remember to keep your report and design up to date.

</p><p>
Tune your algorithm when you are confident that it works correctly. Find
some good values for the parameters. It is impossible to test everything,
but it should be possible to figure out a reasonable parameters set. Again,
report what you do here, such that you, or anyone else, can repeat your
experiments.

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Technical Information</a>
</h1>

<p>
All information we give you about the secret function is that it is of
type [0,1]<sup>10</sup> -&gt; [-2,11].
It is implemented by the class <tt>EA2002</tt>.
This class implements the interface <tt>RealBlackBoxProblem</tt>.
For the documentation of this interface please refer to its <a href="api/RealBlackBoxProblem.html">API
documentation</a>.
This interface allows you to plug this class into an optimizer algorithm.
You may find looking at the source code of the class <tt>SampleEA.java</tt>
useful.
This class implements a (1+1) EA using the class <tt>EA2002</tt> as the fitness
function.

</p><p>
You will have to write a class like <tt>SampleEA</tt> but with the name
<tt>MyEA</tt>.
It has to implement the interface <tt>java.lang.Runnable</tt>,
and has to have a public constructor which accepts one
RealBlackBoxProblem, and an object of type <tt>java.util.Random</tt>,
in this order.
That is, it has to have the signature
</p><pre>public MyEA( RealBlackBoxProblem p, Random r)
</pre>The results of the algorithm have to be reproducible, so all
randomness has to be generated by the given Random object.
This feature is not crucial, it is useful only if you have
complaints over the final result generated by us with your
algorithm . In that case
we can repeat the experiments to prove you that it is indeed correct.

<p>
Do not hard-wire EA2002 into your code, always use <tt>RealBlackBoxProblem</tt>
instead.
You do not have to write a main function like it is done in <tt>SampleEA</tt> but
you might find it useful for experimenting.

</p><p>
Evaluation will be done automatically.
This will involve constructing an instance of the class you hand in with
the constructor described above, and
calling its run method.
During this evaluation every constructed instance of your algorithm
will be allowed to use
1000000 (a million) evaluations of the black box problem.
Apart from that, your algorithm can do anything.
You do not have to worry about recording the best solution, or any other
statistics, the evaluation software will take care of that.
Failure to comply with these
requirements will result in the rejection of your work.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00050000000000000000">
Evaluation Procedure</a>
</h1>

<p>
By Friday 1 November 2002 you are required to hand in your work.
This means you have to send an archive.
The archive must be in tar.gz or zip format, and it has to create a
separate directory when decompressing as opposed to only a collection of files.

The archive has to contain
</p><ul>
<li>
Your source files, i.e. <tt>MyEA.java</tt> and any additional classes that you have written and
are used by <tt>MyEA</tt>.
We do not need your class files, but if you used public libraries, please
include the classes you used in a jar file.
</li>
<li>
The report of at most 6 pages, in which you
describe the algorithm you are using and motivate the choices for the different
components.
Do not forget to include your name in the report.
The document has to be in pdf, or postscript format.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The grade for the performance of your algorithm will be calculated as follows.
The algorithm will be run 10 times, until <tt>MyEA.run()</tt> exits
but at most until 1000000 evaluations each time.
The best function values found during the runs give ten real numbers.
We throw away the smallest one, so nine numbers remain.
These are truncated (not rounded!) to integer (thus 6.0001, 6.5 and 6.999 all
give 6).
The grade is the average of these numbers, this time rounded (not truncated)
to integer.
For example, 6.5 is already 7, but 6.49 is 6.
