Practical assignment for<br>
Evolutionary Computing<br>
October 2003</h1></center>
In this practical assignment you are required to write a program in Java
that optimizes a secret function using an evolutionary algorithm. Besides
of writing the software you will have to write a report in which you describe
your algorithm. This description should include not only the algorithm
components, but also the motivation behind preferring them to others.
<p>The performance of your algorithm determines the half of your grade
for the practical assignment (see later exactly how). Your report (and
programming) will determine the other half<font color="#000000"><b>. </b>The
report should consist of at most four pages, including figures and references.<b>
</b></font>(Do not use a separate banner page, show the names of authors
on the first page, atop.) The final grade of the course is (Practical grade)/4
+ 3(``Tentamen'' grade)/4, in concordance with the distribution of ``study
points''. Note that both grades, the practical and the tentamen, have to
be ``voldoende'', i.e. at least 6.
<p>The practical assignment should be performed in groups of at most three
persons. <b><u><font color="#FF0000">Each group must register a.s.a.p.
before starting the assignment by sending an email to <a href="mailto:schut@cs.vu.nl">Martijn</a>
with the names of the group members.</font></u></b>

<h1>
<a NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000"></a>Things to have in mind</h1>
When you start creating your evolutionary algorithm be sure you have all
the ingredients clearly written down. Here is a list of the most common
ingredients:
<ul>
<li>
representation</li>

<li>
initialization procedure</li>

<li>
variation operators</li>

<ul>
<li>
mutation</li>

<li>
crossover</li>
</ul>

<li>
fitness function</li>

<li>
selection procedures</li>

<ul>
<li>
parent selection</li>

<li>
survivors selection</li>
</ul>

<li>
stop criteria</li>
</ul>
There is no recipe for writing a good evolutionary algorithm for a given
problem. The techniques you have learned during the course provide a toolbox
which you can use to build your algorithm for the given problem. Experiment
with them to find the most suitable ones.
<p>Document your code as this should be easy to read and understand when
we verify your report with your actual running algorithm. When programming,
it is possible that you need to change your initial plans. Maybe because
you overlooked something or maybe because the performance is too low. In
any case, remember to keep your report and design up to date.
<p>Tune your algorithm when you are confident that it works correctly.
Find some good values for the parameters. It is impossible to test everything,
but it should be possible to figure out a reasonable parameters set. Again,
report what you do here, such that you, or anyone else, can repeat your
experiments.
<h1>
<a NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000"></a>Technical Information</h1>
All information we give you about the secret function is that it is of
type [0,1]<sup>10</sup> -> [-2,11]. It is implemented by the class <tt>EA2002</tt>.
This class implements the interface <tt>RealBlackBoxProblem</tt>. For the
documentation of this interface please refer to its <a href="api/RealBlackBoxProblem.html">API
documentation</a>. This interface allows you to plug this class into an
optimizer algorithm. You may find looking at the source code of the class
<tt><a href="SampleEA.java">SampleEA.java</a></tt>
useful. This class implements a (1+1) EA using the class <tt>EA2002</tt>
as the fitness function.
<p>You will have to write a class like <tt>SampleEA</tt> but with the name
<tt>MyEA</tt>.
It has to implement the interface <tt>java.lang.Runnable</tt>, and has
to have a public constructor which accepts one RealBlackBoxProblem, and
an object of type <tt>java.util.Random</tt>, in this order. That is, it
has to have the signature
<pre>public MyEA( RealBlackBoxProblem p, Random r)</pre>
The results of the algorithm have to be reproducible, so all randomness
has to be generated by the given Random object. This feature is not crucial,
it is useful only if you have complaints over the final result generated
by us with your algorithm . In that case we can repeat the experiments
to prove you that it is indeed correct.
<p>Do not hard-wire EA2002 into your code, always use <tt>RealBlackBoxProblem</tt>
instead. You do not have to write a main function like it is done in <tt>SampleEA</tt>
but you might find it useful for experimenting.
<p>Evaluation will be done automatically. This will involve constructing
an instance of the class you hand in with the constructor described above,
and calling its run method. During this evaluation every constructed instance
of your algorithm will be allowed to use 1000000 (a million) evaluations
of the black box problem. Apart from that, your algorithm can do anything.
You do not have to worry about recording the best solution, or any other
statistics, the evaluation software will take care of that. Failure to
comply with these requirements will result in the rejection of your work.
<h1>
<a NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000"></a> How to Submit Your Work</h1>
<b><u><font color="#FF0000">By Monday 17 November 2003 you are required
to hand in your work</font></u></b>. This means you have to send an archive
containing your source files and your report. The archive must be in tar.gz
or zip format, and it has to create a separate directory when decompressing
as opposed to only a collection of files. The archive has to contain
<ul>
<li>
Your source files, i.e. <tt>MyEA.java</tt> and any additional classes that
you have written and are used by <tt>MyEA</tt>. We do not need your class
files, but if you used public libraries, please include the classes you
used in a jar file.</li>

<li>
The report of at most 4 pages, in which you describe the algorithm you
are using and motivate the choices for the different components. Do not
forget to include your name(s) in the report. The document has to be in
pdf, or postscript format.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000"></a>Evaluation Procedure</h1>

<p><br>The grade for the performance of your algorithm will be calculated
as follows. The algorithm will be run 10 times, until <tt>MyEA.run()</tt>
exits but at most until 1000000 evaluations each time. The best function
values found during the runs give ten real numbers. We throw away the smallest
one, so nine numbers remain. These are truncated (not rounded!) to integer
(thus 6.0001, 6.5 and 6.999 all give 6). The grade is the average of these
numbers, this time rounded (not truncated) to integer. For example, 6.5
is already 7, but 6.49 is 6.
<p>If there are any questions regarding the practical assignment direct
them to Martijn by (<a href="mailto:schut@cs.vu.nl">email</a>). Also, whenever
you feel something is wrong with the assignment do not hesitate telling
it. Please watch the local news group <a href="news://vucsm.prac/">vucsm.prac</a>
for any messages regarding updates or other information related to the
practical course. Good luck!
