For each paper, the strengths and weaknesses are listed.  There is at
least one grade, namely the grade that will apply if the paper will
not be revised until the deadline. The deadline is 8 April 2003 if not
negotiated otherwise. So strictly speaking, the papers do not need to
be revised. For several papers, a revision is encouraged. That is,
fixing some of the weaknesses, or building upon some strengths, the
paper could be improved. A better grade for such a revised paper is
then explicitly listed. Two forms of revision are distinguished.
Firstly, a minor revision asks for maturation like covering obvious
omissions in the discussions and completing bibliographic references.
Secondly, a major revision asks for a substantial extension. and for
substantial rewriting, which might imply some extra research. Most of
the weaknesses need to be addressed for both a minor and major
revision, while a major revision normally attempts a more complete job
as opposed to a quick fix done in a minor revision. Some weaknesses
are tagged with "desirable"; this can be taken as an indication that
they are not relevant for a minor revision. Sometimes both a minor and
a major revision are encouraged. Clearly, in this case the major
revision must be regarded as a challenge. In general, the higher the
promised grade, the more difficult it is to succeed. In submitting a
revision, please state clearly why you think that your submission
achieves a minor or a major revision.
