 As the title says the course consists of carrying on a literature study on a topic chose
 in agreement with your supervisor. 

 Select a topic of your interest or a course that you particularly like. <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/cs/staff-en.html">Contact the the
 person in charge of the research area/course</a> you picked and discuss with him the possibility
 to carry out  a literature study under his supervision.

 Once agreed on the topic the study is articulated in three phases:
 <table width="660" cellspacing="20" cellpadding="10" summary="">
 <tr>
   <td>
<ul> 1. Search of related bibliographic material (i.e. papers, reports, etc.) <br></ul>
 <ul>2. Preparation of a slide-show (using any technology and/or tool you feel more apropriate)
 that introduces the topic to an audience of computer scientist 
 that are however not necessarily expert on the topic presented. Following the introduction the
 presentation should illustrate and explain the findings of your study.<br></ul>
 <ul>3. Give a conference-style talk to present the content of your study supported by the slides you just
 prepared. The talk will be given to an audience of CS Master students and possibly scientific staff. The presentation will last 20 minutes with an additional time of 5-10 minutes for questions.<br></ul>
</tr>
</td>
</table>
<br>
The talk will be evaluated and graded by your supervisor.<br>
You have to contact the coordinator to arrange the scheule of your talk or for any further information
about procedural matters.

    <h2>Schedule</h2>

    There will be some days allocated and dedicated to the presentations. Students can
    book and register for a slot to give their presentation by sending a mail to the coordinator. The exact dates will be posted soon on this page. The first one  will be in the second half of November (probably 25th)  and the second one around the middle of December (probably 11th).
