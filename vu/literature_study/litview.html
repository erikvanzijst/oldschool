<blockquote><b><i><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>What is a review
of the literature?</font></font></i></b>
<br><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>A literature review is an
account of what has been published on a topic by accredited scholars and
researchers. Occasionally you will be asked to write one as a separate
assignment (sometimes in the form of an annotated bibliography--see the
bottom of the next page), but more often it is part of the introduction
to an essay, research report, or thesis. In writing the literature review,
your purpose is to convey to your reader what knowledge and ideas have
been established on a topic, and what their strengths and weaknesses are.
As a piece of writing, the literature review must be defined by a guiding
concept (e.g., your research objective, the problem or issue you are discussing,
or your argumentative thesis). It is not just a descriptive list of the
material available, or a set of summaries.</font></font><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Besides enlarging your knowledge
about the topic, writing a literature review lets you gain and demonstrate
skills in two areas:</font></font>
<br><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>information seeking: the
ability to scan the literature efficiently, using manual or computerized
methods, to identify a set of useful articles and books</font></font>
<br><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>critical appraisal: the ability
to apply principles of analysis to identify unbiased and valid studies.</font></font><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>A literature review must
do these things:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>a) <i>be organized around
and related directly to the thesis or research question you are</i></font></font></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
developing</font></font></i></b>
<br><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>b) <i>synthesize results
into a summary of what is and is not known</i></font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>c) <i>identify areas of
controversy in the literature</i></font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>d) <i>formulate questions
that need further research</i></font></font></b></blockquote>
<b><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Ask yourself questions like
these:</font></font></b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>What is the specific thesis,
problem, or research question that my literature review helps to define?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>What type of literature review
am I conducting? Am I looking at issues of theory? methodology? policy?
quantitative research (e.g. on the effectiveness of a new procedure)? qualitative
research (e.g., studies )?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>What is the scope of my literature
review? What types of publications am I using (e.g., journals, books, government
documents, popular media)? What discipline am I working in (e.g., nursing
psychology, sociology, medicine)?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>How good was my information seeking?
Has my search been wide enough to ensure I've found all the relevant material?
Has it been narrow enough to exclude irrelevant material? Is the number
of sources I've used appropriate for the length of my paper?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Have I critically analysed the
literature I use? Do I follow through a set of concepts and questions,
comparing items to each other in the ways they deal with them? Instead
of just listing and summarizing items, do I assess them, discussing strengths
and weaknesses?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Have I cited and discussed studies
contrary to my perspective?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Will the reader find my literature
review relevant, appropriate, and useful?</font></font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Ask yourself questions
like these about each <u>book or article</u> you include:</font></font></b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Has the author formulated a problem/issue?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Is it clearly defined? Is its
significance (scope, severity, relevance) clearly established?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Could the problem have been approached
more effectively from another perspective?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>What is the author's research
orientation (e.g., interpretive, critical science, combination)?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>What is the author's theoretical
framework (e.g., psychological, developmental, feminist)?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>What is the relationship between
the theoretical and research perspectives?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Has the author evaluated the
literature relevant to the problem/issue? Does the author include literature
taking positions she or he does not agree with?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>In a research study, how good
are the basic components of the study design (e.g., population, intervention,
outcome)? How accurate and valid are the measurements? Is the analysis
of the data accurate and relevant to the research question? Are the conclusions
validly based upon the data and analysis?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>In material written for a popular
readership, does the author use appeals to emotion, one-sided examples,
or rhetorically-charged language and tone? Is there an objective basis
to the reasoning, or it the author merely "proving" what he or she already
believes?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>How does the author structure
the argument? Can you "deconstruct" the flow of the argument to see whether
or where it breaks down logically (e.g., in establishing cause-effect relationships)?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>In what ways does this book or
article contribute to our understanding of the problem under study, and
in what ways is it useful for practice? What are the strengths and limitations?</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>How does this book or article
relate to the specific thesis or question I am developing?</font></font></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>Final Notes:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>A literature review
is a piece of discursive prose, not a list describing or summarizing one
piece of literature after another. It's usually a bad sign to see every
paragraph beginning with the name of a researcher. Instead, organize the
literature review into sections that present themes or identify trends,
including relevant theory. You are not trying to list all the material
published, but to synthesize and evaluate it according to the guiding concept
of your thesis or research question.</font></font><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Century Gothic"><font size=-1>If you are writing an annotated
bibliography, you may need to summarize each item briefly, but should still
follow through themes and concepts and do some critical assessment of material.
Use an overall introduction and conclusion to state the scope of your coverage
and to formulate the question, problem, or concept your chosen material
illuminates. Usually you will have the option of grouping items into sections--this
helps you indicate comparisons and relationships. You may be able to write
a paragraph or so to introduce the focus of each section.</font></font></blockquote>
