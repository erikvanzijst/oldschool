Compiler Construction Study Guide
</H2><HR>

<P>
Compiler construction is one of the oldest, most successful and most mature
computer science subjects.
Compilers were used in the 1950s to compile the first FORTRAN programs; they
are used today to do JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation of downloaded Java
applets.
Compilers can produce code optimized for high speed (usually), for extremely
small size (for code in video recorders, etc.) or even for low energy
consumption (for cell phones).
In the past, awkward and slow machines taxed compiler construction techniques
to the limit.
Although these techniques have improved considerably over the years,
present-day distributed systems again tax compiler builders to the limit.
Compiler construction techniques are used in web browsers, Postscript
interpreters, and automatic language translation.
</P>

<P>
The course is intended for students who have at least used a compiler
and have given some thought to the notion of compilation.
It is based on the book
"<A HREF="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dick/MCD.html">Modern Compiler Design</A>"
by Grune, Bal, Jacobs and Langendoen.
As part of the internationalization effort, the course is taught in English.
</P>

<P>
The book consists conceptually of two parts.  The first part covers
the general compilation process, and contains three chapters based on
the analysis/processing/synthesis paradigm: text analysis, context
handling and code generation.  The second part consists of four
chapters, covering the paradigm-specific problems of imperative and
object-oriented, functional, logic and parallel and distributed
programs.  The two parts are separated by a chapter on memory
management/garbage collection.
</P>

<P>
To bring order to the multitude of compiler construction techniques, the
course is based on three unifying ideas:
</P>

<UL>

<LI>
Lexical analysis, LR parsing and BURS code generation are recognized as
instances of <B>bottom-up pattern matching</B>.
This unifies three important techniques in compiler design, and allows the
students to adapt them to fit their needs.
</LI>

<LI>
Many complicated compiler construction techniques can be viewed as being
the result of
<B>precomputation</B>: partial results of an underlying simpler algorithm are
computed in advance and the results saved inside the compiler in tabular form.
This view significantly reduces the mental effort to understand these
techniques.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>Closure algorithms</B> are introduced wherever possible, thus unifying
many seemingly different algorithms.
</LI>

</UL>

<P>
The exact material covered in the course differs from year to year, but can be
counted on to include
Chapter 1 (introduction),
Chapter 2 (program analysis),
Chapter 3 (context checking) with or without attribute grammars,
large parts of Chapter 4 (code synthesis),
Chapter 5 (memory management),
large parts of Chapter 6 (code transformation for imperative and
object-oriented languages),
and selected parts from one of the other paradigm chapters,
to a total of about 550 pages (out of about 700).
The
<A HREF="ExamTopics">exam topics</A>
will be published at the end of each year's course.
</P>

<H3>
Subjects that have scored badly in previous exams
</H3>

<P>
A few, including:
</P>

<UL>

<LI>
LR parsing.
</LI>

<LI>
Ordered attribute grammars (when applicable).
</LI>

<LI>
Static link.
</LI>

<LI>
Full back-tracking search in Prolog (when applicable).
</LI>

</UL>
