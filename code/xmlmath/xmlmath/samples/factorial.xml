Factorial? Why another factorial? There's already <fact> for this.
True, this merely serves to illustrate how complex operations can be built
using the basics. Using <fact> would of course evaluate faster.
Change the declaration of "x" to compute the factorial of a specific number.

Remember: xmlmath uses 64-bit, signed integers, making 2^63 - 1 the biggest
achievable number. This is not large enough to hold the result of factorials
larger than 20!
