{INTRODUCTION

 Turbo Pascal is designed for all types of users who want to develop
 applications for the DOS operating system. Whether you are a beginner
 about to write your first program, an experienced developer curious about
 object-oriented programming, or a longtime Turbo Pascal user, Turbo
 Pascal offers you a rich programming environment that makes software
 development more productive - and more fun. Using Pascal's structured,
 high-level language, you can write programs for any type of size of
 application.

 Turbo Pascal 7.0 brings you new capabilities while remaining compatible
 with code written using earlier versions. While exploring the opportunities
 that await you, remember that this is still Turbo Pascal, the quick and
 efficient Pascal compiler that is the world's standard.


 HOW TO USE THE TURBO PASCAL MANUALS

 Turbo Pascal comes with four manuals, each with a different purpose.

 You'll find the User's Guide helpful if

 - You want to know how to install Turbo Pascal
 - You've used Turbo Pascal before and you want to know what is new in this
   release
 - You want to learn how to use Borland's integrated development environment
   (the IDE) to develop and debug programs
 - You want to learn about units and how to write your own
 - You haven't used pointers in your programs before or you need to refresh
   your pointer knowledge
 - You're new to object-oriented programming


 The Language Guide focuses on the Turbo Pascal language and explains how to
 get the most out of it. Use the Language Guide to

 - Find the formal definition of the Turbo Pascal language including detailed
   syntax diagrams covering every Turbo Pascal construct
 - Learn how the run-time library is organized and how to use it
 - Discover the procedures, functions, predeclared variables, constants, and
   so on that are in the run-time library and available for your programs to
   use
 - Find out how Turbo Pascal programs use memory
 - Learn how Turbo Pascal implements program control
 - Find out how your programs can use a 80x87 coprocessor
 - Learn how Turbo Pascal optimizes code
 - Find out how to use Turbo Pascal with assembly language


 The Programmer's Reference is a reference to the details you'll need as you
 write your programs. You'll want to keep this volume by your computer as you
 program.

 Use the Programmer's Reference when you want to

 - Look up the details of a particular run-time library procedure, function,
   variable, type, or constant and find out how to use it
 - Understand how compiler directives work, what each compiler directive does,
   and how to use them
 - Find out what an error message means
 - Learn how to use the command-line compiler
 - Look up editor commands
 - Look up compiler directives in a quick reference
 - See a list of reserved words and standard directives


 The Turbo Vision Guide is your guide to Turbo Vision, the application frame-
 work that gives you a head start on object-oriented programming. To master
 Turbo Vision, you'll want to

 - Work through the tutorial to get hand-on experience developing a Turbo
   Vision application
 - Study the Turbo Vision hierarchy and become acquainted with the object
   types
 - Learn the meaning of event-drive programming and what it entails        }
