Compiling:

If your system meets the requirements, this is how to compile (and install):

	./install.sh


KDialer will install itself in your KDE bin directory and will setup the
Help pages.


Or do it by hand and ditch the little script by typing:

	gcc -I$QTDIR/include -I$KDEDIR/include -L$QTDIR/lib -L$KDEDIR/lib -lqt -lkdecore -lkdeui -lXext -o kdialer kdialer.cc

But I guess the script is easier ;)
I kept everything in one file and I was too lazy make a Makefile, but I'm
sure you'll succeed in typing the above command.
I will make a Makefile some day, I promise ;)

If the compile fails, check if you have Qt (at least 1.32) properly
installed and KDE is properly setup and is running.
If it still fails, you can rebuild the moc file by typing:

	moc -o kdialer.moc kdialer.cc
	gcc -I$QTDIR/include -I$KDEDIR/include -L$QTDIR/lib -L$KDEDIR/lib -lqt -lkdecore -lkdeui -lXext -o kdialer kdialer.cc

Any questions?
