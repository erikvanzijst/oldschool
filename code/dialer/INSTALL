Compiling:

If your system meets the requirements, this is how to compile:

	./install.sh


After compilation, the executable is named dialer and sits in this
directory. You'll have to copy it to a directory in your path yourself. (eg.
/usr/local/bin).

Or do it by hand and ditch the little script by typing:

	gcc -lqt -o dialer dialer.cc


I kept everything in one file and I was too lazy make a Makefile, but I'm
sure you'll succeed in typing the above command. :)

If the compile fails, check if you have Qt (at least 1.32) properly
installed.
If it still fails, you can rebuild the moc file by typing:

	moc -o dialer.moc dialer.cc
	gcc -lqt -o dialer dialer.cc


Any questions?
