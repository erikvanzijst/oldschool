New: I have added a 'kdemapping' to the distribution.

You should generate Postscript documents form the sgml
source with the following command:

> sgml2latex -p letter --style=kde  --output=ps  kdefaq.sgml
  
a) don't use -p a4. Most of the world uses letter and a4 is not
properly usable on letter installtions, while letter is very
well usable on a4 installtions.

b) --style=kde this will instruct Latex to use the PostScript
Times fonts instead of hte ugly Computer Modern fonts. This
will not only beautify the documents immensely but also
shrink their size by a factor of 10 or more.

c) --oupt=ps  this is selfexplanatory.

Please know that kdesgmltools were originally named "niceSgml2Html",
and some references to the old name still occur. I will fix that
but it may take some time :-)
