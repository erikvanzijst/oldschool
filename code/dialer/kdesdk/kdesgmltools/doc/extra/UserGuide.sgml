This is the User's Giude to kdesgmltools version 0.6 (former known as niceSgml2Html), 
a package that extends the functionality 
of sgml-tools, when it comes to formating an sgml document as html.
</abstract>
</titlepag>

<sect>General

<p>This document is also available in 
<htmlurl url="http://users.hol.gr/~vrypan/cactus/doc/niceUG.dvi.gz" name="DVI format"> and
<htmlurl url="http://users.hol.gr/~vrypan/cactus/doc/niceUG.ps.gz" name="Postscript format">.

<p>sgml-tools is an SGML-based formating system which allows you to produce a 
variety of output formats. For more information visit <htmlurl 
url="http://www.xs4all.nl/~cg/sgmltools" 
name="http://www.xs4all.nl/~cg/sgmltools">. 

<p>Even though sgml-tools is an exelent system, in some cases it is 
insufficient. One of those is when you want to publish on the Internet
a document you wrote. The HTML output is spartian; it may be great when you 
are only interested in converting the original document to HTML so that 
anyone, using any HTML browser will be able to read it, but when it comes to 
aesthetics...

<p>Even so, it has many advantages; when you write the document you do not 
have to worry about the apearence details and you can always convert the 
original document to LaTeX and print it.

<p>The idea behind kdesgmltools is to modify the original tools (included in 
sgml-tools) that are responsible for the conversion from SGML to HTML in such 
a way that we can get better-looking HTML output.

<sect>Installation
<p>The current version of kdesgmltools is v0.6 .
This version works with sgml-tools-1.0.0 and MAY NOT WORK WITH OLDER VERSIONS.

<p>The installation is now automated.
<p>Create an empty directory and move there kdesgmltools-0.6.tar.gz. Extract 
the contents with
<verb>gzip -dc kdesgmltools-0.5.tar.gz | tar xv </verb>
<p>Type:<verb>
# ./configure
# make install
</verb>

<sect>What you get
<p>From version 0.5 many things have changed. So, even if you were familiar
with older versions, read this chapter.
<p>When you originally wanted to create HTML from SGML you used the command
<verb>sgml2html sgmlfile.sgml</verb>
Now you have a new option invoced with --nice or -N.
<p>Typing <verb>sgml2html --nice sgmlfile.sgml</verb> activates the 
kdesgmltools modifications. I strongly recomend using --nice in association 
with --imagebuttons (same as -I).
<p>You also get a new mapping from sgml to html called "nice" too :-)

<sect>Theory <label id="theory">
<p>Part of the sgml-tools system is a perl module called Html2Html.pm.
<p>When you activate the option --nice (or -N), instead of 
Html2Html.pm, a new module called niceHtml2Html.pm is used.

<sect1>Html2Html.pm
<p>In order to understand how to use effeciently the --nice option you have
to know exactly what Html2Html.pm is doing.
<p>When you format an sgml document with sgml2html, it is filtered
using some programs, in such way that the sgml tags defined in the 
appropriate dtd (Document Type Description) are replaced by html tags.
<p>This could be straight-forward but the problem is that the output of
sgml2html is not one file; the document is split to several files,
as many as the sections it contains. This makes sense; you wouldn't
want to download a whole book from your browser, just to read the
"credits" section!
<p>This is what causes the main trouble; the internal links are destroyed
and they must be redefined so that they point to the right file. This is a job for
Html2Html.pm. This is why if you take a look at html/mapping you
will see that some sgml tags are not replaced by html tags but by strange
<@@abcd> tags. Those tags are important for Html2Html.pm.
<p>Html2Html.pm adds more value to your documents by creating a Table of Contents
and taking care of some other little thing like the navigation icons or words
that appear at the top and bottom of each page and point to the next and previous
section as well as to the Table of Contents.

<sect1>niceHtml2Html.pm
<p>What Html2Html.pm creates is a fully functional set of html documents.
<p>The body of each document starts with the buttons mentioned above (either
as text or iconic) and goes on with the text of your document.
<p>niceHtml2Html.pm is a hacked version of Html2Html.pm. It does all what
the original Html2Html does plus, it inserts user-defined html tags at certain
critical sections of the document. Those are:
<sect2>SectionA
<p>We will call SectionA the section between the &lt/TITLE&gt; tag and the
&lt;/HEAD&gt; tag. Here is where we may insert &lt;META&gt; tags or any
other tag that could go in the HEAD of an html document.
<sect2>SectionB
<p>SectionB is between &lt;/HEAD&gt; tag and the first line of our document.
Note that the &lt;BODY&gt; tag belongs to SectionB.
<sect2>SectionC
<p>SectionC is just before the &lt;/BODY&gt; tag.
<sect2>BarTags1i and BarTags2
<p>BarTags1 are the tags inserted just before the navigation buttons
and BarTags2 are inserted just after them.

<p>So, your resulting document will look like this:
<verb><HTML>
&lt;HEAD>
&lt;TITLE>The test document&lt;/TITLE>
---------------->PartA
&lt;/HEAD>
---------------->PartB
		containing &lt;BODY>
---------------->BarTags1
(The buttons)
---------------->BarTags2

(The text of the document)

---------------->BarTags1
(The buttons)
---------------->BarTags2
---------------->PartC
&lt;/BODY>
&lt;/HTML>
</verb>

<p>The advantages are obvious! You can define in an important degree
the look of your document.

<sect>Practice
<p>If you have read the <ref id="theory" name="Theory Section"> it
will be easy to understand how to use kdesgmltools.
<sect1>--nice option
<p>As stated above, when you type <verb>sgml2html --nice &lt;file&gt;.sgml</verb>
you can insert html tags at certain poionts of your document.
Those tags are read from the file named <tt/&lt;file&gt;.nif/ which
MUST be present at the directory where you issue the sgml2html
command.
<p>The structure of this file is simple. It is a text file containing
the html tags for the above mentioned sections. Each section begins with
a line like this:
<verb><--A--></verb>
for SectionA. The lines <verb>
<--B-->
<--C-->
<--BarTags1-->
<--BarTags2-->
</verb>are used in the same way.
<p>You must be careful since SectionB MUST contain a &lt;BODY&gt;
tag.
<p>A useful tip. If you use the word DOCNAME in any BarTags section
it will be replaced by the title of the document.

<sect1>--style=nice
<p>In <ref id="theory" name="Theory"> I mentioned the substitution of
sgml tags by html tabs which is done by Html2Html.pm (and consequently
by niceSgml2Html.pm). This substitution is described in a file
called <tt/mapping/. This file is found somewhere in your sgml-tools
tree and looks like this:<verb>
<name>          +       "<H3>"                  +
&etago;name>         +       "&etago;H3>"                 +     
</verb>
<p>These two lines state that the &lt;name&gt; tag will be replaced
by &lt;H3> tag and &etago;name> tag by &etago;H3>. The + signs indicate
newline.
<p>You may define alternative mappings. If you call sgml2html using
the option <tt/--style=my/, sgml-tools will look for a file named
<tt/mymapping/ at the same directory where <tt/mapping/ resides.
I have created a mapping called by <tt/--style=nice/, which I find
better. If you like it you may use it.

<sect1>Navigation Icons
<p>Just like the documents created by the original sgml2html,
documents created with <tt/--nice/ in combination with <tt/--imagebuttons/,
will look for <tt/next.gif/, <tt/prev.gif/, <tt/toc.gif/ and an additional one, 
<tt/blank.gif/.
<p><tt/blank.gif/ is only needed when using the <tt/--nice/ option and it is
used when it does not make sence to put one of the other navigation buttons.
For example, it is used where the <tt/next.gif/ would be used on the last page of
our document, or in the place of <tt/toc.gif/ on the <it/Table of Contents/ page.
<p>What's more, nice looking icons are included in the kdesgmltools package and
may be used instead of the original icons. These icons are created using 
<htmlurl url="http://www.ginp.org" name="The Gimp"> and are based on icons
found at the <htmlurl url="http://www.iconbazaar.com/" name="http://www.iconbazaar.com/">. 
 

<sect>Examples of "nif"s (nice include files)

<sect1>minimal nif
<p>The minimal nif would be:
<verb>
&lt;--B-->
&lt;BODY>
</verb>
<p>This will actually have the same result as if you did not use
the --nice option.

<sect1>cactus style nif
<p>This is the nif I used for my www

<sect>Especially for kde documentation.
<p>If you want your resulting HTML file to have the "kde look", a small
script called ksgml2html is included in the package. 
<p>ksgml2html creates an appropriate niceInclude file (nif) in the directory where it is
invoced from and runs sgml2html with the right options. When you run it
you will be asked for the "Description" and the "keywords". The answers
will form two META tags in the resulting HTML document, useful for
search engines.

<sect>What now?
<p>kdesgmltools will continue to evolve. New features will be added. For more
information and news visit <htmlurl url="http://users.hol.gr/~vrypan/cactus"
