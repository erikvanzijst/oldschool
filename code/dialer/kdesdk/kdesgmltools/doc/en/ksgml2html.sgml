A brief intro to ksgml2html.

</titlepag>

<sect>General
<p>ksgml2html is part of the kdesgmltools package. kdesgmltools allows the user
to create good-looking HTML output from sgml (linuxdoc.dtd) files. There are many
things you can do with kdesgmltools, but if you just want the HTML output
to have the KDE look, just use ksgml2html.
<sect>Use
<p>Go to the directory where your SGML file is.
Type <tt>ksgml2html filename</tt>
<p>You will be asked for the <bf/Description/ and the <bf/keywords/.
<p>Type in a short description for your document, and the related keywords.
<p>These data will be included in the resulting HTML files as META tags. They
are used by numerous search engines like AltaVista to classify and query HTML pages.
<p>The description and the keywords will be saved with other neccessary data in a file
named after your sgml document with the extention "nif". The next time you use
ksgml2html for this document you will be informed that <tt>..existing nif file is used</tt>.
If you want to change the description or the keywords, just remove this "nif" file and
run ksgml2html again.
