This program is not yet finished due to problems regarding the modem
control.
My original post on usenet (comp.unix.programmer) has grown to a big thread,
discussing the (dis)advantages of cuaX and ttySX, rather than giving usefull
tips on fixing my problem.

For those who did not (completely) read the thread, I'll give a short
summery of the problem:

Origionally, the dialer used /dev/cua1 to make the modem dial a number. More
or less this came down to this:

  int modem;
  char *number = "ATDT1234567890\r\n";
  if (modem = open("/dev/modem", O_WRONLY) == -1) exit(0);
  write(modem, number, strlen(number));
  sleep(4);     // modem dials
  close(modem);

It worked on kernel 2.0.33 but after I switched to 2.1.98 all dialing
attempts fail.

Currently the dialer uses some more sophisticated routines (thanks to H.
Peter Anvin), but even that doesn't fix it.
For more info, read the thread (/dev/cua1 became obsolete in 2.1.XX? Now
what?) on comp.unix.programmer / comp.os.linux.development.apps /
comp.os.linux.development.system / comp.os.unix.admin or
comp.os.linux.hardware

If you manage to fix it, *please* contact me, rather than fixing and
distributing it yourself.
The modem is being opened in line 726 (in function void
DialerWindow::dial_slot()) The phonenumber is being sent to the modem in
function DialWindow::DialWindow(QWidget *parent, const char
*name):QDialog(parent, name, TRUE) on line 499.


I'll be looking forward to your replies.
