Rob thinks I'm lazy,....well, I am, but within seven weeks there will be a playable kmonop-version.

You'll won't see any changes for the next three weeks, because I'm going to Calella.

This will be the KDE client (kmonop). It is being developed by Leon van
Zantvoort (cybor@prutser.cx).

Type 'make' to compile.

Note that the current Makefile is known not to work with preinstalled KDE
and Qt (such as Red Hat 6.0), as they don't use the KDEDIR and QTDIR
variables.
Fix it or wait for us to fix it. Don't wine.

First start the monop server, than kmonop. Press the arrow icon to connect.
You will have to start the server on localhost because I hardcoded the
hostname in the client

you can change it in kmonop.cc : line 105
