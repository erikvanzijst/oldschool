KMonop - useless developer release


INSTALLATION

	tar zxvf monop-devel.tgz
	cd monop
	make

Eventually the monop binary will appear. Since the client will come later,
the only way to get some life is to telnet to the monop port (2525).

run ./monop and telnet to port 2525. See the API file for the commands to
roll the dice etc.
For very early preview of the KDE KMonop client, do this:

	cd kmonop
	make
	./kmonop	(make sure you have monop server running)


README

The complete suite will exist of this server (see it as a text mode,
dedicated deamon) and one client: the KDE client: KMonop.
The very first signs of some GUI-life can already be found in the subdir
kmonop/ Note that that client is not being written by me. Harras
leon@prutser.cx for that.

Eventually, it will become quite easy for third party developers to write
a client in a different environment (say GTK/Gnome) by studying the (not yet
complete) network API. The actual monopoly game routines are all being
handled by the server, so a GTK version would only be a GUI app with some
TCP code.


Every day a new snapshot will automatically be made available at my own
machine: www.prutser.cx/~icehawk/kmonop/monop-devel.tgz
This is not garanteed to even compile! (no cvs yet)
